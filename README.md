# 👋 Hi, I’m @HAKAMIQ

🎮 I’m interested in Emulation, Retro Gaming, and turning low-end hardware into gaming beasts.

🛠️ I’m currently working on Arabic guides for emulators, shader packs, and game compatibility tables.

💡 I’m looking to collaborate on retro-focused emulator tools, performance patches, and educational gaming content.

⚡ Fun fact:  
I can optimize RetroArch with my eyes closed and explain BIOS setup while making a cup of gahwa ☕  
Also... I still believe PS2 memory card has a soul.
